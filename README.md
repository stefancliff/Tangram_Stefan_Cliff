# A tangram game made only inside OpenGL (without shaders)

The goal of the project was to create a working animal puzzle (tangram) game that had internal constant checking of the rotation, scale and postion of each piece following a blueprint/exoskeleton as a guide as well as a completed smaller copy on the side somewhere.

During this project I learned a bit more on how computers actually "see" or rather how we get computers to show us images that we as humans can perceive in a more logical way.
